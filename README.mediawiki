= redis =

Fast bindings to redis using hiredis. Note that you will need to fetch
the git submodules in this package. These provide only the
synchornous API and at the moment do not provide timeouts but will do
so one day.

:(redis-connect hostname port)

Connect to a redis host, will produce an error if the connection
fails. Returns an opaque pointer to the redis context.

:(redis-command context string)

Send the string as a command to redis and parse the reply. Arrays are
converted into lists.

=== Example ===

   (redis-command (redis-connect "127.0.0.1" 6379) "keys *")

This will produce a list of strings, the keys in the redis database.
